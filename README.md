in the beginning there was the shameless stealing of [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiUpAeos168)

then i proceeded to mush together the code in script2d.js (can't remember where i copied it from. let me know if you recognize it).

in the end i opted for the more "complex" formula for the main force, but the other version has one more layer of unpredictability.
this one is maybe "too" stable.

you can modify the values in the parameter's tables by moving the mouse over the cell and pressi the UP/DOWN KEY (not the best, i know).

you can reset all the values in the current parameter's table by pressing the RIGHT CTRL KEY.

keep in mind that the lower the mass the faster the particle, to the point that at mass = 0 something drastic is bound to happend.

P KEY to pause the time.

D KEY to not draw the particles.


you can adjust other parameters (num particlse(1000 def), nun type of particles(6 def), and many other).
if you watch the explanation in the video you can figure out the rest.
